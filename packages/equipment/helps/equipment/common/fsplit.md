# Fluid splitter

![Fluid splitter](./fsplit-01.png)

- Brief summary

Fluid splitter is a device that divides the fluid entering the inlet node into the two outlet nodes.

- How it works

The amount of fluid discharged to the two outlets is adjusted according to the split rate (SR) given by the user. If SR is 100%, all the fluid is discharged through the first outlet. If SR is 0%, all the fluid flows to the second outlet.
Users can enter the pressure drop occurring in a fluid splitter. Since the pressure drop greatly depends on the design and operating conditions of the fluid splitter, a professional analysis is required to make an accurate prediction.

- Applications in STED platform

One fluid stream can be split into two streams, which can be fed to two different devices.
