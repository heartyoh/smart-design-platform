# Rotary Dryer

- Brief summary

A rotary dryer (rotary kiln) dries objects by moving them in the rotational and axial directions of a cylinder.

- How it works

A rotary dryer is installed so that the cylindrical axis is inclined with respect to the ground, and the drying occurs while the objects rotate with respect to the cylindrical axis and move in the axial direction. The drying process can be controlled by adjusting the temperature of the heat source and the residence time of the objects.

- Applications in STED platform

This module can design a roatary dryer (rotary kiln) within the dryer module.
