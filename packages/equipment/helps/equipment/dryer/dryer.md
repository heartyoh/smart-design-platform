Defines the amount of moisture that can be dried.
Defines the temperature for determining the initial state.

- Working priciple

The maximum amount of moisture that can be evaporated from the drying material is defined through the total amount of drying material input to the dryer and the initial moisture content and equilibrium moisture content of the drying material.

- Utilization in STED Platform
  - Calculate the initial moisture content and temperature of the object inherited as child objects.
  - The heat contained in the outlet hot air can be used in other processes in the platform.
