# Boiler Burner for High Volumetric Heat Release Rate

- Brief summary

This device generates heat by the chemical reaction of fuel and air, and it is suitable to a small and medium capacity industrial boiler with high volumetric heat release rate.

- How it works

This device operates in a premixed combustion mode in order to minimize NOx and CO concentrations of exhaust gas in a boiler with high volumetric heat release rate. Flames are generated at the surface of metal fiber mat using fuel and air premixture supplied from premixing chamber. Operation optimization is required to operate this device because the flame characteristics and exhaust NOx, CO concentrations vary widely accoring to operating conditions such as fuel to air ratios.

- Applications in STED platform
  - Heat can be supplied to the boiler using gaseous fuels such as natural gas or propane gas.
  - This module can be used to desing a burner for steam boiler.
