# Bag Filter

![Bag Filter](./post-tr-bf-01.png)

- Brief Summary
  - Defined as an dust collection equipment separate dust from industrial facility exhaust gas using filter bag
  - According to filter bags, various range of temperature & types of exhaust gas can be applied
  - Have advantage of below sub-micron size particle separation which impossible in case of cyclone
- How it works
  - Gas passes through the pore in filter bag & solid particle captured on filter bags
  - Captured solid particle is removed from filter bag by pulsing air and stored at filter housing bottom
  - The stored solid particle is periodically eject to filter housing outside
  - Filter bag cleaning by pulsing air is reused for particle separation
- Applications in STED platform
  - Separation of fine solid particle(difficult to separate in cyclone) from process exhaust gas
