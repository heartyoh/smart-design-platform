- Brief summary

The cyclone dust collector is a device that collects and removes fine particles contained in the gas using centrifugal force generated when the gas rotates.

- How it works

Centrifugal force was used to separate the solid or liquid dust from the gas. The particles move to the wall of the perimeter and then precipitate to the floor while the gas with particles moves in a spiral shape. After that, the clean gas is discharged through the exit while performing upward spiral motion.

- Applications in STED platform

It is used when particles are to be removed from the incoming gas
