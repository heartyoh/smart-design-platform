# Heat exchanger

- Brief summary

A heat exchanger is a device that efficiently transfers heat from a high-temperature fluid to a low-temperature fluid, and generally handles fluids such as liquids or gases. Heat exchangers are used for heating and cooling purposes depending on the intended use.

- How it works

It works by exchanging heat between the high-temperature fluid and the low-temperature fluid through convective heat transfer and structure conduction.

- Application in STED Platform
  - You can choose a heat exchanger type among three heat exchangers of plate, cell&tube, and fin&tube.
  - It is possible to calculate the outlet condition with the heat transfer rate and inlet condition given in the process design.
